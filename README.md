Because I can. Maybe.

Current iteration is based on [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style), the web components that are going to become
[Web Awesome](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fontawesome/web-awesome). I'm aiming to have very little global CSS
(if any) so that it will fit into multiple projects without having to contort those projects to fit it.

Anyway, this is more of an experiment than anything else. No idea if this will actually be useful to anyone, including myself. Use at your own (very substantial!) risk.

## To install

Good news: Don't have to install/configure Tailwind!

Bad news: I haven't tested a new install. Working on it!
